# Problem: Maximize Number of 1's  
**Platform:** GeeksforGeeks  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

## Problem Statement
Given a binary array `arr[]` (containing only 0s and 1s) and an integer `k`, you are allowed to flip at most `k` 0s to 1s. Find the **maximum number of consecutive 1's** that can be obtained in the array after performing the operation at most `k` times.

---

## Approach
This problem can be efficiently solved using the **Sliding Window** technique to maintain a window of valid elements while tracking the maximum length of consecutive 1's.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables**:
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window.
   - Track the count of 0s in the window with `zeroCount`.

2. **Expand the Window**:
   - Traverse the array with the `right` pointer.
   - Increment `zeroCount` when a 0 is encountered.

3. **Shrink the Window**:
   - If `zeroCount > k`, move the `left` pointer to shrink the window, reducing `zeroCount` if a 0 is removed.

4. **Update the Maximum Length**:
   - For each valid window (where `zeroCount <= k`), calculate the length of the window and update the maximum length.
