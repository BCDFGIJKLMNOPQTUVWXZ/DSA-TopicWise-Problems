# K-th Element of Two Arrays

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Platform**: Geeks for Geeks 

---

## Problem Statement

You are given two **sorted arrays** `a[]` and `b[]` of sizes \( n \) and \( m \), respectively. Your task is to find the element that would appear at the \( k \)-th position in the **merged sorted array** of `a[]` and `b[]`.

---

## Input Format

1. An integer \( T \), the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Two integers \( n \) and \( m \), the sizes of arrays `a[]` and `b[]`.
   - The array `a[]` of size \( n \), sorted in ascending order.
   - The array `b[]` of size \( m \), sorted in ascending order.
   - An integer \( k \), the position of the element to find in the merged sorted array.

---

## Output Format

For each test case, output the \( k \)-th element of the combined sorted array.

---

## Constraints

- \( 1 \leq T \leq 100 \)
- \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq n + m \)
- \( -10^9 \leq a[i], b[j] \leq 10^9 \)
